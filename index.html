      I find browsing cards in the card section at stores to be quite fun. They’re so varied and creative!
      I especially like the pop up cards and the ones that play music when you open them up but the
      songs and sound quality is usually so BAD! So here’s a better version of a musical card
      (but also one with way more space for my massive paragraphs). This is the song I was listening to on 
      repeat on the plane as I was writing this letter so here's a musical card to give you the full experience haha.

      Happy holidays!! Thanks so much for entering my life!
    </p>

      ✨ <strong>You’re better than I could have imagined!</strong> ✨
    </p>

    <p>
      I thought I had a clear idea of what I wanted in a good S.O. but you exceed my imagination.
      When I’m with you, I don’t feel like I’m just being prioritized — I feel like the priority.
      Your affectionate gaze, enthusiasm, and genuine curiosity makes me feel like I’ve finally
      found someone who matches how deeply I care in a relationship. And that’s SO VERY EXCITING!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for taking up the role of being so invested and vulnerable first. I admire how you were
      able to do that so quickly despite me being quite confusing and not being able to show as much 
      validation in the beginning. I think a large part of how we were able to become so close so 
      quickly was thanks to you gaining my trust from doing that so early on. It’s so nice being in a
      relationship where I don’t have to hold back much thanks to all the validation and certainty you give.
    </p>

    <p>
      You mentioned that one night that you felt so invested because you feel such high potential in
      this relationship. I also feel the same way which I find really interesting and surprising -- 
      normally it takes me a lot longer to feel that way. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Spending time with you talking, cuddling, smelling you, kissing, laughing together, listening to 
      your colorful commentary on shows/life, waking up next to you, doing kitchen experiments together, 
      badminton, ice skating, eating good food, walks in the rain, car rides with your hand on my leg and 
      fun red light stops, your entertaining long texts, and your creative and funny placements of the plushies 
      in your room are all memories that stand out to me so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s to creating more montage moments!
