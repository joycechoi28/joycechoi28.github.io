      I find browsing cards in the card section at stores to be fun. They’re so varied and creative!
      I especially like the pop up cards and the ones that play music when you open them up but the
      songs and sound quality is usually so BAD! So here’s a better version of a musical card
      (but also one with way more space to write the massive paragraphs I have to say).
      WANTCHU is the song I was listening to on repeat on the plane as I was writing this letter so
      having that background song play while you read this letter will give you the full experience haha.

      Happy holidays!! Thanks so much for entering my life!

      ✨ <strong>You’re better than I could have imagined!</strong> ✨
    </p>

    <p>
      I thought I had a clear idea of what I wanted in a good S.O. but you exceed my imagination.
      When I’m with you, I don’t feel like I’m being prioritized — I feel like the priority.
      Your affectionate gaze, enthusiasm, and genuine curiosity makes me feel like I’ve finally
      found someone who matches how deeply I care in a relationship. And that’s SO VERY EXCITING!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for taking up the role of being so invested and vulnerable first. I admire how you were
      able to do that so quickly despite me being quite confusing and not showing much validation in
      the beginning. I think a large part of how we were able to become so close so quickly was thanks
      to you gaining my trust from doing that so early on. It’s so nice being in a relationship where
      I don’t have to hold back much thanks to all the validation and certainty you give.
    </p>

    <p>
      You mentioned that one night that you felt so invested because you feel such high potential in
      this relationship. I also feel the same way which I find really interesting and surprising;
      because normally I wait a lot longer of a time to come to a conclusion like that since I’m
      pretty rational and try to collect a lot of data points before getting emotionally invested
      to that extent. I think I’m still quite rational in your case too but I’ve just done my logical
      analysis a lot faster haha.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spending time with you talking, cuddling, smelling you, kissing, laughing together (although
      usually it’s AT me 😒), listening to your spicy commentary on shows/life, waking up next to you,
      doing kitchen experiments together, badminton, ice skating, eating good food, walks in the rain,
      car rides with your hand on my leg and fun red light stops, your entertaining long texts, and
      your creative and funny placements of the plushies in your room are all memories that stand out
      to me so far.

    <p>
      Here’s to creating more montage moments for you!
